**Plus** is superset of PHP that makes PHP cool again. It was created by
**[Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro)**, and it's built on top of
**[Pre](https://preprocess.io)** - a preprocessing tool for PHP. **Plus**'s art work
is provided by **[Caneco](https://twitter.com/caneco)**.

Plus is a **runtime compiler** that adds features to PHP - It's also a package that you can require using
composer, and is mainly used to add features and syntactic sugar to existant PHP code. Of course, those features
arrive in PHP using runtime source code transformations.

Enjoy a simple and powerful syntax that enables developers to build very complex applications far more quickly
than before. Short closures, types, enumerations are just a few examples of what you get using **Plus**.
